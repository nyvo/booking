Coding & Design Rules

These rules define how the AI assistant (Claude) should generate UI and code for this project.

1. Tech Stack

All generated frontend code MUST assume:

React 19

TypeScript

Vite

Tailwind CSS v4

shadcn/ui components

No other UI frameworks or styling systems should be introduced (e.g. no MUI, no Chakra, no styled-components).

2. Product Context

This is a yoga booking app with two core surfaces:

2.1 Teacher Dashboard

Used by yoga teachers to:

Manage class schedules

See upcoming sessions

View student lists & attendance

Track earnings & payouts

This surface does use a sidebar navigation.

2.2 Student Booking Experience

Used by students to:

Discover classes + teachers

Browse by day/time/level/location

Book and pay

This surface must NEVER have a sidebar.
It should feel open, calm, friendly, and non-admin-like.

3. Design System
3.1 Style Inspiration

Inspired by calm SaaS aesthetics such as Cluely:

Soft, muted colors

Lots of whitespace

Subtle gradient background washes

Large, readable headings

Minimal clutter

A light, breathable look

The overall feel should be calm, soft, and welcoming — not corporate or busy.

4. Colors

Use a limited soft palette, mapped to CSS variables:

primary: soft blue (#4E95FF)

accent: soft lavender or mint (#A5B4FC or #A7F3D0)

bg: very light neutral (#F9FAFB)

surface: white or near-white

border: light gray (#E5E7EB)

muted: soft neutral for secondary text

Color Rules

Use primary sparingly for CTAs and small highlights.

Use accent for subtle pills, tags, and soft visual anchors.

Avoid loud colors or neon gradients.

Most surfaces should be white or near-white.

5. Gradients

Gradients may be used as ambient washes, not decorative effects.

Use a helper like:

.bg-soft-gradient {
  background:
    radial-gradient(circle at top left, rgba(78, 149, 255, 0.18), transparent 55%),
    radial-gradient(circle at bottom right, rgba(148, 163, 253, 0.22), transparent 55%);
}

Gradient Rules

At most two gradient sections per page.

Keep gradients soft, subtle, and low-opacity.

Never use high-saturation or harsh diagonal gradients.

6. Typography

Use a clean geometric sans (Geist/Inter-like).

Headings should be large but calm — not marketing-loud.

Body text should be comfortable to read with medium line-height.

Suggested scale:

h1: text-3xl–text-4xl

h2: text-2xl

h3: text-xl

Body: text-sm–text-base

Meta text: text-xs with muted color

Do not use ALL CAPS except for tiny labels.

7. Spacing & Radii

Allowed spacing scale: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32.

No random spacing values.

Cards/surfaces: rounded-xl, rounded-2xl, or rounded-3xl.

Pills/tags: rounded-full.

Avoid tiny radii (rounded-sm).

8. Components & Styling
8.1 Cards

Use light borders, minimal shadow:

<Card className="border border-border/60 shadow-sm rounded-3xl bg-white/80 backdrop-blur" />

8.2 Buttons

Prefer outline (variant="outline") and soft variants.

Use solid primary buttons sparingly.

All buttons and links MUST have cursor-pointer on hover.

Always add `cursor-pointer` or ensure it's applied by default.

8.3 Icons

Use icons only for clarity, never decoration.

8.4 Dialogs & Sheets

Use Dialog for confirmations (e.g., booking confirmation).

Use Sheet for mobile-specific overlays (filters, details).

9. Layout Patterns
9.1 Overall Rules

Generous whitespace.

Clear vertical hierarchy.

Minimal visual clutter.

Limited components per screen.

Mobile-first behavior must be intentional.

10. Sidebar Rules (Important Update)
10.1 Teacher Dashboard — Sidebar Allowed & Recommended

The Teacher Dashboard uses the shadcn Sidebar.

Rationale:

Teachers have multi-section workflows.

Sidebar reduces clutter versus cramming into a top nav.

Creates clarity and predictable structure.

Matches common patterns in productivity apps.

Sidebar rules:

Use shadcn/ui Sidebar component.

Light style: border divider, no heavy shadows.

Soft hover states (bg-primary/5).

Icons optional; text should be clear alone.

Group navigation items with whitespace, not lines.

Sidebar should feel airy — not dense like an admin panel.

10.2 Student Booking — Sidebar NOT Allowed

The Student Booking Experience must never use a sidebar.

Reason:

Students have one simple focus: find & book a class.

Sidebars introduce unnecessary complexity.

Layout must feel open, calm, and less “dashboard-like”.

Only use:

Top nav

Day selector

Filters

Class list

11. Page-Specific Layouts
11.1 Teacher Dashboard Layout

Recommended concept: Calm Split Pane with Sidebar

Structure:

[Sidebar] | [Main Area]


Main Area:

Top nav (light, simple)

Two-pane content:

Left: list/timeline of upcoming classes

Right: selected class details + actions

Mobile:

Sidebar collapses to a sheet.

Timeline list → class detail navigation.

11.2 Student Booking Layout

Recommended concept: Calendar-First Single Column

Structure:

Soft gradient top section with calm heading.

Horizontal day selector.

Filter chips.

Single-column class cards.

Booking via dialog or sheet.

Mobile-friendly sticky bottom bar (optional).

12. Tailwind & shadcn Rules
12.1 Tailwind

Use Tailwind classes inside JSX.

Group className values by purpose: layout → spacing → typography → color → misc.

Don’t create new arbitrary values unless justified.

12.2 shadcn

Use shadcn components by default:

Button, Card, Input, Select

Dialog, Sheet, Tabs, Avatar

Sidebar (Teacher Dashboard only)

Avoid building raw HTML components unless necessary.

13. Workflow for Claude Prompts

Claude MUST follow these steps when designing UI:

Step 1 — UX Concepts (no code)

Claude must:

Propose 3 distinct layout concepts.

Each concept must include:

Name

Short explanation

ASCII wireframe

How it supports yoga workflows

How it avoids generic SaaS patterns

Sidebar must only appear in Teacher Dashboard concepts.

Step 2 — Implementation

After a concept is chosen, Claude must:

Generate React 19 + TS + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui.

Follow the wireframe exactly.

Use sidebar only if the surface is the Teacher Dashboard.

Never introduce extra sections.

Apply the soft calm design system.

14. DOs and DON’Ts
DO

DO use sidebar for Teacher Dashboard.

DO avoid sidebar for Student Booking.

DO keep UI soft, light, and spacious.

DO present layout concepts before coding.

DO use gradients subtly.

DO use outline buttons often.

DO use shadcn components.

DON’T

DON’T use “default SaaS” patterns blindly.

DON’T use dense admin-like tables.

DON’T use dark themes or harsh gradients.

DON’T overuse icons.

DON’T add sections that weren’t approved.

DON’T add a sidebar to student pages.
