Coding & Design Rules

These rules define how the AI assistant (Claude) should generate UI and code for this project.

1. Tech Stack

All generated frontend code MUST assume:

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components

No other UI frameworks or styling systems should be introduced (e.g. no MUI, no Chakra, no styled-components).

2. Product Context

This is a yoga booking app with two core surfaces:

2.1 Teacher Dashboard

Used by yoga teachers to:

- Manage class schedules
- See upcoming sessions
- View student lists & attendance
- Track earnings & payouts

This surface does use a sidebar navigation.

2.2 Student Booking Experience

Used by students to:

- Discover classes + teachers
- Browse by day/time/level/location
- Book and pay

This surface must NEVER have a sidebar.
It should feel open, calm, friendly, and non-admin-like.

3. Design System

3.1 Style Inspiration

Inspired by calm SaaS aesthetics such as Cluely:

- Soft, muted colors
- Lots of whitespace
- Subtle gradient background washes
- Large, readable headings
- Minimal clutter
- A light, breathable look

The overall feel should be calm, soft, and welcoming — not corporate or busy.

4. Colors

Use a limited, soft palette mapped to CSS variables:

- primary: soft blue (#4E95FF)
- primary-subtle: very light blue wash for backgrounds (#EFF4FF)
- accent-lavender: soft lavender (#A5B4FC)
- accent-mint: soft mint (#A7F3D0)
- bg-canvas: warm light neutral (#F5F4F1)
- bg-muted: soft gray neutral (#F3F4F6)
- surface: white or near-white (#FFFFFF)
- border: light gray (#E5E7EB)
- muted: soft neutral for secondary text (#64748B)

Color Rules

- The main page background MUST NOT be pure white.
  - Use bg-canvas for the outer page background.
  - Use surface (white) ONLY for cards and elevated content.
- Use primary sparingly for:
  - Main CTAs
  - Small highlights (time pills, active day, active nav item)
- Use accent-lavender or accent-mint for:
  - Tags
  - Soft “status” or “level” labels
- Avoid loud colors or neon gradients.
- Most surfaces should be white or near-white, sitting on top of a slightly tinted background so there is clear separation.

5. Gradients

Gradients may be used as ambient washes, not decorative effects.

Use a helper like:

.bg-soft-gradient {
  background:
    radial-gradient(circle at top left, rgba(78, 149, 255, 0.14), transparent 55%),
    radial-gradient(circle at bottom right, rgba(148, 163, 253, 0.16), transparent 55%);
}

Gradient Rules

- At most two gradient sections per page.
- Gradients should sit behind content (page background, hero area), never on individual cards.
- Keep gradients soft, subtle, and low-opacity.
- Never use high-saturation or harsh diagonal gradients.

6. Typography

Use a clean geometric sans (Geist) — this is the primary font.

Headings

- h1: text-3xl–text-4xl, font-semibold, tracking-tight
- h2: text-2xl, font-medium or semibold
- h3: text-xl, font-medium

Body

- Body: text-sm–text-base, line-height relaxed.
- Meta: text-xs with muted color.

Rules

- Do NOT use ALL CAPS except for tiny labels (meta).
- Text color defaults:
  - Primary text: slate-900 / text-primary
  - Secondary text: text-muted-foreground
- Never use very low-contrast light grey on white for key information.

7. Spacing & Radii

Allowed spacing scale: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32.
No random spacing values.

Cards / surfaces:

- rounded-2xl or rounded-3xl for main cards.
- rounded-xl for smaller inline surfaces (list items, compact cards).

Pills / tags:

- rounded-full.

Avoid tiny radii (no rounded-sm).
Global layout should have generous section padding (24–32px) and consistent vertical rhythm.

8. Components & Styling

8.1 Cards

Use light borders, minimal shadow:

<Card className="border border-border/60 shadow-sm rounded-3xl bg-white/90 backdrop-blur" />

Rules:

- Cards MUST have a visible border OR a clear background contrast against the page (never flat-white-on-white).
- Important / “next class” cards can have a subtle left border or top border in primary-subtle, NOT a full solid primary block.
- Use padding 16–24px inside cards.

8.2 Buttons

- Prefer soft/outline buttons for secondary actions.
- Reserve solid primary buttons for 1–2 key actions per screen.

Examples:

Primary CTA:

<Button className="rounded-full px-4 py-2 text-sm font-medium">
  Book class
</Button>

Secondary / outline:

<Button variant="outline" className="rounded-full px-3 py-1.5 text-sm">
  Edit schedule
</Button>

Rules:

- All buttons and clickable elements MUST show interactive affordance:
  - cursor-pointer
  - subtle background or border change on hover
- Do not fill the entire header with multiple solid buttons – there should be one visual primary action at most.
- Use solid primary buttons sparingly.

8.3 Icons

- Use icons only for clarity, never decoration.

8.4 Dialogs & Sheets

- Use Dialog for confirmations (e.g., booking confirmation).
- Use Sheet for mobile-specific overlays (filters, details).

9. Layout Patterns

9.1 Overall Rules

- Generous whitespace.
- Clear vertical hierarchy.
- Minimal visual clutter.
- Limited components per screen.
- Mobile-first behavior must be intentional.

9.2 Teacher Dashboard — Sidebar Layout

Recommended concept: Calm Split Pane with Sidebar

Structure:

[Sidebar] | [Main Area]

Main Area:

- Top nav (light, simple)
- Two-pane content:
  - Left: list/timeline of upcoming classes
  - Right: selected class details + actions

Mobile:

- Sidebar collapses to a sheet.
- Timeline list → class detail navigation.

9.3 Top Navigation (Teacher Dashboard & Student Booking)

General Style

- Background: white with slight blur and bottom border:
  className="bg-white/80 backdrop-blur border-b border-border/80"
- Height: comfortable (56–72px), not cramped.

Layout:

- Left: logo + product name
- Center (optional): page title or simple breadcrumb
- Right: 1 primary button, 1–2 secondary actions as outline/text buttons

Rules

- Do NOT use multiple equally styled pill buttons across the top.
- Primary action: solid primary button.
- Secondary actions: outline or subtle ghost buttons with text-muted-foreground.
- Nav should feel like a thin calm bar, not a heavy toolbar.

Teacher Dashboard

- Can include:
  - Page title (e.g., “Dashboard” / “Schedule”)
  - A primary CTA (e.g., “New class”)
  - A secondary CTA (e.g., “Export”, “Share”)

Student Booking

- Simpler:
  - Logo on the left
  - Maybe a single “Sign in” / “My bookings” button on the right.
- Never add complex nav or admin-style groupings here.

10. Sidebar Rules (Important Update)

10.1 Teacher Dashboard — Sidebar Allowed & Recommended

The Teacher Dashboard uses the shadcn Sidebar.

Rationale:

- Teachers have multi-section workflows.
- Sidebar reduces clutter versus cramming into a top nav.
- Creates clarity and predictable structure.
- Matches common patterns in productivity apps.

Sidebar rules:

- Use shadcn/ui Sidebar component.
- Light style: border divider, no heavy shadows.
- Soft hover states (bg-primary/5).
- Icons optional; text should be clear alone.
- Never use emojis instead of icons.
- Group navigation items with whitespace, not lines.
- Sidebar should feel airy — not dense like an admin panel.

10.2 Student Booking — Sidebar NOT Allowed

The Student Booking Experience must never use a sidebar.

Reason:

- Students have one simple focus: find & book a class.
- Sidebars introduce unnecessary complexity.
- Layout must feel open, calm, and less “dashboard-like”.

Only use:

- Top nav
- Day selector
- Filters
- Class list

11. Page-Specific Layouts

11.1 Teacher Dashboard Layout

Recommended concept: Calm Split Pane with Sidebar

Structure:

[Sidebar] | [Main Area]

Main Area:

- Page background: bg-canvas or bg-soft-gradient.
- Main content sits in white cards on top of this background.
- At least one primary “hero” card for “Next class” or “Today”.
- Under that: list/timeline of upcoming classes in smaller, lighter cards.

Each pane should use:

- Max width constraints for readability.
- Clear vertical spacing (16–24px between sections).
- No dense table grids; use card-like rows instead.

Mobile:

- Sidebar collapses to Sheet.
- Timeline list → class detail navigation.

11.2 Student Booking Layout

Recommended concept: Calendar-First Single Column

Structure:

- Soft gradient top section with calm heading.
- Horizontal day selector.
- Filter chips.
- Single-column class cards.
- Booking via dialog or sheet.
- Mobile-friendly sticky bottom bar (optional).

12. Tailwind & shadcn Rules

12.1 Tailwind

- Use Tailwind classes inside JSX.
- Group className values by purpose: layout → spacing → typography → color → misc.
- Don’t create new arbitrary values unless justified.

12.2 shadcn

Use shadcn components by default:

- Button, Card, Input, Select
- Dialog, Sheet, Tabs, Avatar
- Sidebar (Teacher Dashboard only)

Avoid building raw HTML components unless necessary.

13. Workflow for Claude Prompts

Claude MUST follow these steps when designing UI:

Step 1 — UX Concepts (no code)

Claude must:

- Propose 3 distinct layout concepts.

Each concept must include:

- Name
- Short explanation
- ASCII wireframe
- How it supports yoga workflows
- How it avoids generic SaaS patterns

Sidebar must only appear in Teacher Dashboard concepts.

Step 2 — Implementation

After a concept is chosen, Claude must:

- Generate React 19 + TS + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui.
- Follow the wireframe exactly.
- Use sidebar only if the surface is the Teacher Dashboard.
- Never introduce extra sections.
- Apply the soft calm design system.

14. DOs and DON’Ts

DO

- DO use sidebar for Teacher Dashboard.
- DO avoid sidebar for Student Booking.
- DO keep UI soft, light, and spacious.
- DO present layout concepts before coding.
- DO use gradients subtly.
- DO use outline buttons often.
- DO use shadcn components.

DON’T

- DON’T use “default SaaS” patterns blindly.
- DON’T use dense admin-like tables.
- DON’T use dark themes or harsh gradients.
- DON’T overuse icons.
- DON’T add sections that weren’t approved.
- DON’T add a sidebar to student pages.
