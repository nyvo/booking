# Project Summary - Yoga Booking App

## Recent Session (2025-11-09)

### Work Completed
Updated availability display across all student-facing pages to use clearer Norwegian language.

#### Availability Language Update
**Problem:** "3 av 8" was ambiguous - unclear if 3 or 5 spots were available
**Solution:** Changed language to be explicit: "3 ledige av 8 plasser" (3 available of 8 spots)

**Files Updated:**
1. `/src/pages/student/Browse.tsx` - Preview cards
   - Changed to: `{availableSpots} ledige plasser` with number in font-medium, text muted
   
2. `/src/pages/student/ClassDetail.tsx` - Detail page
   - Label: "Tilgjengelighet" 
   - Value: `{availableSpots} ledige av {capacity} plasser` (font-medium text-foreground)
   
3. `/src/pages/student/CourseDetail.tsx` - Detail page
   - Label: "Tilgjengelighet"
   - Value: `{availableSpots} ledige av {capacity} plasser` (font-medium text-foreground)
   
4. `/src/pages/student/EventDetail.tsx` - Detail page
   - Label: "Tilgjengelighet"
   - Value: `{availableSpots} ledige av {capacity} plasser` (font-medium text-foreground)

**Design Decisions:**
- Browse cards: Number emphasized, text muted ("3 ledige plasser")
- Detail pages: Entire line in uniform font-medium to match other categories (Date, Time, Location)
- Word "ledige" (vacant/available) makes it unambiguous what the number represents
- Kept clean, consistent styling - no oversized/bold numbers

## Previous Work (Context)

### Terminology Updates
- "Timer" → "Enkeltkurs" (single classes)
- "Kurs" → "Kursrekker" (course series)
- "Events" → "Arrangementer" (arrangements/events)
- "Studenter" → "Påmeldte/Påmeldinger" (enrolled students → registrations)
- Updated breadcrumbs, buttons, page titles, and navigation throughout

### Dashboard Improvements
- Shows mixed class types (Enkeltkurs, Kursrekker, Arrangementer)
- Maximum 5 items, sorted by date
- Type badges for visual distinction
- Fixed stat card to show combined total count

### Browse Page Decluttering
- Removed description, tags, and duration details from preview cards
- Condensed date/time/location to single line with bullet separators
- Kept availability (now with clear language)
- Clean, scannable card design

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Bookings page TypeError (PaginatedResponse structure)
- Fixed dashboard count showing wrong total
- Fixed filter spacing on Browse page

## Current State
All planned updates completed. App has clear Norwegian terminology, improved UX, and consistent design patterns.

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

### Potential Areas to Explore:
1. **Testing & QA**
   - Test all three class types (Enkeltkurs, Kursrekker, Arrangementer)
   - Verify booking flows work correctly
   - Check responsive design on mobile devices
   - Test with different data states (full classes, empty states, etc.)

2. **Additional Features** (if requested)
   - Email notifications system
   - Payment integration
   - Calendar view for classes
   - Teacher analytics/reporting
   - Student profiles and history

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review API calls and caching strategies
   - Optimize component re-renders
   - Bundle size analysis

4. **Polish & Refinement**
   - Additional UI/UX improvements
   - Accessibility enhancements
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Form validation improvements

**Note:** Wait for user direction before starting new work. Current implementation is complete and functional.
